Where do written numerals come from? Why do they emerge in societies, and take the diverse forms that they do? This repo contains experiments that try to answer that question using simple communication games, to see what constraints lead people to use different kinds of graphical representations of number.


Below is a guide to the various studies in this repo.

## draw_number
The original task, consisting of 4 shapes by 8 cardinalities.
Data collected in early 2020.

## rate_iternum
Abandoned early version of classify_iternum. This can be ignored; and should probably be deleted?

## classify_iternum
Recognition task for the original data.
Data collected from the end of 2020 through early April 2021.

## draw_number_2
First extension beyond the proof of concept in first task.
Slightly new format, consisting of 6 cardinalities, a more constrictive time limit on each production trial, and an 'ink' limit to reduce the number of strokes people make.


Files in the 'analysis' folder are as follows.

*datastructures* is a file for temporarily saving out many of the data structures that need to be passed between analysis files (e.g. python to R)

*iternum_analysis* is the principal file for analyzing
