- N = 3 (6 subjects: 2 per game for 3 games)
- Basic summary of experimental design:
    - The stimuli set made by crossing two features, cardinality (ranging from 1:8) and animal type (3 types: deer, bears, owls), for a total of 24 images ("3 owls", "8 bears", etc).
    - For every round, the target image (out of 4 images presented to the subjects) was selected by randomly drawing from the stimulus set without replacement (for a total of 24 trials), under the additional condition that every cardinality should appear once in each third of the experiment (i.e. draw without replacement from {1:8} 3 times in a row).
    - The distractors for each trial were drawn according to the sole condition that they not have the same cardinality as the target
    - Overall context (the kinds of cardinalities and types of animals subjects have seen so far in the experiment) was not specifically manipulated.

Plans for future iterations (to get what we want):
    - Change the stimuli so that rather than see the exact same images, the sketcher and viewer are shown different constellations (i.e. same number of same animal per image, but scattered differently on the background) and sketcher can therefore not rely on the constellation of animals on the image while constructing their message.
    - Feature larger cardinalities? Shorten the sketcher's time limit? (Because, it seems that drawing 8 circles is easily achieved in the 30 seconds we allow, making abbreviated representation unlikely to arise; but that's what we're interested in).
    - Introduce an 'animal group' of subjects (as opposed to the 'cardinality group). For games in the animal group, draw distractors according to the rule that they might share the cardinality with the target, but are never the same animal (think about how chance means something different for cardinality than for animal type, given that it's 3x8, and how to account for that). This will provide a control group where cardinality info is not selected for by the distractor set.

Plans for future iterations (tentative; to test new ideas):
    - Manipulate 'overall context' so that for the first half of the experiment, subjects only see cardinalities above (a) or below (b)some N, and only in the second half are shown cardinalities including below or above N, respectively, to elicit extensions of whatever conventions have been developed (and to either inhibit (a) or catalyze (b) the development of a base system)
